Status:-

**Bias** measures how much the **predicted function (model)** **differs from the true function**.
such as linear regression for squigly lines will give good prediction but not great but it will give it consistly

methods for finding sweet spot between both the bias and variance is regularization,boosting and bagging
**Variance** measures how much the model's predictions **change with different training data**.

Expected Error Generalized
$$
E[(f^​(x)−f(x))^2]=Bias^2+Variance+Irreducible Error
$$

main goal is to achieve low MSE
