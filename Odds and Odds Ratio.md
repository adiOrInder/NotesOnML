odds is ratio of no. of times it happened by it didn't happen

OR
$$
odds = \frac{P(A)}{1-P(A)}
$$
when we visualize this on number the odds of not happening tends to 0
and corresponding to that tends to infinity it is not easy visualize so we the log of odds (logit function)

odds ratio is like R-squared which shows the relation between two odds

There three methods predicting if the the odds ratio is good
i> Fischer enrichment test 
	for finding p-value you take of sum of probability of getting rare or rarer element
